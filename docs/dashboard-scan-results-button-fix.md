# Dashboard Scan Results Button and Supabase URL Validation Fix

## Issues

### Issue 1: View Results Button Error

On the dashboard page, the "View Results" button for website scans was not working correctly and produced the following error in the console:

```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
    at onClick (page-5f5e6d103750950b.js:1:14393)
```

The issue was in the `DashboardContent.tsx` file where the code was trying to access the `id` property of `website.latest_scan` using a non-null assertion operator (`!`), but in some cases `website.latest_scan` was undefined.

### Issue 2: Invalid URL Error

After fixing the first issue, a new error appeared:

```
тип TypeError: Invalid URL
   at eval (./src/lib/supabase.ts:25:90)
```

This was caused by the Supabase URL being invalid or empty when creating the Supabase client.

## Root Causes

### Root Cause 1: Inconsistent Fallback Pattern

In the `DashboardContent.tsx` file, there was an inconsistency in how the code accessed the `latest_scan` property. Throughout most of the file, a fallback pattern was used:

```tsx
(website.latest_scan || createDefaultScan(website))
```

This pattern ensures that even if `latest_scan` is undefined, the code falls back to a default scan object created by the `createDefaultScan` function.

However, in the "View Results" button's onClick handler, this fallback pattern was not used:

```tsx
onClick={() => handleViewResults(website.latest_scan!.id)}
```

Instead, it used the non-null assertion operator (`!`), which assumes that `latest_scan` is never undefined. When `latest_scan` was indeed undefined, this caused the error.

### Root Cause 2: Missing URL Validation

In the `supabase.ts` file, there was no validation to ensure that the Supabase URL was a valid URL before creating the Supabase client. If the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` was empty or invalid, it would cause a runtime error when creating the client.

## Fixes

### Fix 1: Consistent Fallback Pattern

The fix was to use the same fallback pattern consistently throughout the code:

```tsx
onClick={() => handleViewResults((website.latest_scan || createDefaultScan(website)).id)}
```

This ensures that even if `latest_scan` is undefined, the code will use the default scan object created by `createDefaultScan`.

### Fix 2: URL Validation

Added validation to ensure the Supabase URL is valid before creating the client:

```typescript
// Ensure supabaseUrl is a valid URL
try {
  // Test if the URL is valid by creating a URL object
  new URL(supabaseUrl);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Invalid Supabase URL:', supabaseUrl);
  throw new Error(`Invalid Supabase URL: ${supabaseUrl}`);
}
```

This validation catches invalid URLs early with a clear error message, rather than failing later with a cryptic error.

## Implementation

1. Modified `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` to use the fallback pattern in the onClick handler.
2. Modified `src/lib/supabase.ts` to add URL validation before creating the Supabase client.
3. Created a script `scripts/fix-dashboard-scan-results.cjs` to automate both fixes and restart the application.

## Verification

After applying the fixes:
1. The "View Results" button should work correctly.
2. No errors should appear in the console when clicking the button.
3. The user should be redirected to the scan results page.
4. The application should start without "Invalid URL" errors.
