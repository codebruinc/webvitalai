# Reports Page Scan Results Fix

## Issue
Users were unable to view past scan results from the dashboard when clicking the "View Results" button. The button was supposed to navigate to the dashboard page with the scan ID as a URL parameter, but this navigation wasn't working properly.

## Solution
Instead of redirecting to the dashboard page, we've modified the reports page to directly display scan results when a user clicks on "View". This approach has several advantages:

1. It eliminates the redirection issue that was causing the "View Results" button to fail
2. It provides a more seamless user experience by showing results in a modal on the same page
3. It maintains the context of the reports list while viewing individual scan results

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. **Modified the reports page (`src/app/reports/page.tsx`):**
   - Added state variables to track selected scan, loading state, and errors
   - Implemented a function to fetch scan results directly from the API
   - Added a modal component to display scan results
   - Changed the "View" link to a button that triggers the fetch function
   - Reused the existing `ScanResults` component to display the results

2. **Created a test script (`scripts/test-reports-view.cjs`):**
   - Verifies that the test user exists or creates it
   - Ensures test websites are properly associated with the user
   - Creates test scan data with metrics if needed
   - Provides instructions for manual testing

### Key Components

- **Fetch Function:** Retrieves scan results from the API using the scan ID
- **Modal Component:** Displays scan results in a modal overlay
- **Error Handling:** Shows appropriate error messages if results can't be loaded
- **Loading State:** Displays a loading spinner while fetching results

## Testing

### Automated Test Setup
Run the test script to set up the necessary test data:

```bash
node scripts/test-reports-view.cjs
```

This script will:
- Verify or create a test user with UUID: 203c71f3-49f7-450d-85b9-a2ff110facc6
- Set up test websites with IDs: 282d7f05-06d8-4836-8d64-dac53845912c and 15f062a7-4114-4a40-840c-63f6a9b5e6f5
- Create test scans with IDs: 18550822-3306-4ea0-bbd2-655a0dd7b30d and 1c3129b5-ee5a-4ec5-8958-950add1308c6
- Add test metrics data for the scans

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Log in as the test user (or any user with access to the test scans)
2. Navigate to the reports page
3. Verify that the test scans are listed in the table
4. Click the "View" button for a scan
5. Verify that a modal appears showing the scan results
6. Check that all scan metrics and details are displayed correctly
7. Close the modal and verify you can view other scan results

### Expected Results

- The reports page should load and display a list of scans for the user
- Clicking "View" should open a modal with the scan results
- The scan results should include performance, accessibility, SEO, and security scores
- Premium users should see detailed information including issues and recommendations
- The modal should close when clicking the X button or outside the modal

## Verification

This fix has been tested with the following scan IDs:
- 18550822-3306-4ea0-bbd2-655a0dd7b30d
- 1c3129b5-ee5a-4ec5-8958-950add1308c6

And with user UUID: 203c71f3-49f7-450d-85b9-a2ff110facc6

The implementation successfully displays scan results directly on the reports page without requiring navigation to the dashboard page.
