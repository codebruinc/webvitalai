# Login Rate Limit Fix

## Issue

The application was experiencing authentication errors:

1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: 
   ```
   Request rate limit reached: kittwppxvfbvwyyklwrn.supabase.co/auth/v1/token?grant_type=password:1
   Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 ()
   Login error: AuthApiError: Request rate limit reached
   ```

2. **Refresh Token Errors**:
   ```
   [AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found] {
     __isAuthError: true,
     name: 'AuthApiError',
     status: 400,
     code: 'refresh_token_not_found'
   }
   ```

## Solution

The fix implements several improvements to the login process:

### 1. Rate Limiting Protection

- Added client-side rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Tracks login attempts and enforces increasing wait times between attempts
- Provides user-friendly error messages with countdown timers

### 2. Refresh Token Handling

- Added specific handling for refresh token errors
- Automatically signs out the user when refresh token errors occur
- Provides clear messaging to the user about session expiration

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- Enhanced error categorization and specific handling for different error types
- Improved user feedback for authentication issues
- Proper error logging for debugging

## Implementation Details

The fix was implemented in `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` by:

1. Adding state variables to track login attempts and timing
2. Implementing an exponential backoff algorithm
3. Adding specific error handling for rate limit and refresh token errors
4. Improving the user experience with clear error messages

## How to Test

1. Run the restart script to apply the changes:
   ```
   ./restart-login-fix.sh
   ```

2. Test login with incorrect credentials multiple times in quick succession
   - You should see the rate limit protection activate
   - Error messages should indicate how long to wait

3. Test with valid credentials after a session expiration
   - The system should handle refresh token errors gracefully
   - User should be able to log in again without errors

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:

1. Server-side rate limiting for additional protection
2. Persistent login attempt tracking (currently resets on page refresh)
3. Integration with a monitoring system to alert on unusual login patterns
