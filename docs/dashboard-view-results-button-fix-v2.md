# Dashboard "View Results" Button Fix V2

## Issue
The "View Results" button on the dashboard was not working. When clicked, nothing happened - no errors were displayed in the console, and the user was not redirected to the scan results page.

## Root Cause
After investigating the issue, we found several potential problems:

1. The `handleViewResults` function in DashboardContent.tsx was not properly validating scan IDs before navigation
2. The dashboard page component was not properly handling the scan ID parameter in the URL
3. There might be issues with how scan data is being fetched and displayed

## Fix
The fix addresses these issues by:

1. Enhancing the `handleViewResults` function to validate scan IDs and reject those with a "default-" prefix
2. Improving the View Results button's onClick handler to include more logging and better error handling
3. Enhancing the dashboard page component to better handle scan IDs and provide more detailed logging

### Changes to DashboardContent.tsx
```typescript
// Before
const handleViewResults = (scanId: string) => {
  console.log('handleViewResults called with scanId:', scanId);
  
  // Try different router navigation methods
  try {
    console.log('Using router.push with full URL');
    // Use the full URL to ensure proper navigation
    const fullUrl = `/dashboard?scan=${encodeURIComponent(scanId)}`;
    console.log('Navigating to:', fullUrl);
    
    // Force a hard navigation to ensure the page reloads
    window.location.href = fullUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Navigation error:', error);
  }
};

// After
const handleViewResults = (scanId: string) => {
  console.log('handleViewResults called with scanId:', scanId);
  
  if (!scanId || scanId.startsWith('default-')) {
    console.warn('Invalid scan ID:', scanId);
    return;
  }
  
  try {
    console.log('Using window.location.href for navigation');
    // Use the full URL to ensure proper navigation
    const fullUrl = `/dashboard?scan=${encodeURIComponent(scanId)}`;
    console.log('Navigating to:', fullUrl);
    
    // Force a hard navigation to ensure the page reloads
    window.location.href = fullUrl;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Navigation error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Changes to dashboard/page.tsx
The useEffect hook that handles scan IDs has been enhanced to:
1. Validate scan ID format and reject those with a "default-" prefix
2. Provide more detailed logging
3. Improve error handling

## Implementation
- Modified `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` to enhance the handleViewResults function and View Results button onClick handler
- Modified `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to enhance the useEffect hook that handles scan IDs
- Created `scripts/fix-dashboard-view-results-button-v2.cjs` to apply the fix
- Added documentation in `docs/dashboard-view-results-button-fix-v2.md`

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the "View Results" button for a completed scan
4. Verify that the scan results are displayed correctly
5. Check the browser console for any errors or warnings

## Related Issues
This fix builds on previous fixes for the dashboard "View Results" button:
- The original fix that changed from using `router.push()` to `window.location.href` for navigation
- The scan ID format fix that prevented using scan IDs with a "default-" prefix
