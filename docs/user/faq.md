## Scanning and Analysis

### How long does a scan take?
Most scans complete within 30-60 seconds, depending on the size and complexity of your website. Larger websites may take longer.

### How accurate are the results?
Our analysis is based on industry-standard tools like Lighthouse and axe-core, providing highly accurate results. However, some issues may require human judgment to determine their actual impact on your specific website.

### Can I scan multiple pages at once?
Currently, WebVital AI scans one URL at a time. For Premium users, you can queue multiple scans to run sequentially.

### Does WebVital AI scan my entire website?
WebVital AI scans the specific URL you provide. To analyze your entire website, you would need to scan individual pages separately.

### How often should I scan my website?
We recommend scanning your website at least once a month, or after making significant changes. Premium users can set up automated scans on a regular schedule.

Yes, you can scan any publicly accessible website. This can be useful for benchmarking your performance against competitors.

## Performance Metrics

### What are Core Web Vitals?
Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important for user experience:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): measures loading performance
- First Input Delay (FID): measures interactivity
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): measures visual stability

### What is a good performance score?
A score of 90-100 is considered excellent, 50-89 is good but has room for improvement, and below 50 indicates significant performance issues that should be addressed.

### How can I improve my performance score?
Common improvements include optimizing images, reducing JavaScript, implementing caching, and using a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Our AI recommendations provide specific actions for your website.

### Do mobile and desktop scores differ?
Yes, mobile and desktop scores often differ significantly due to different device capabilities and network conditions. Mobile scores are typically lower due to device limitations.

## Accessibility

### What accessibility standards does WebVital AI check?
WebVital AI checks for compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines using axe-core, the industry-standard accessibility testing engine.

### Why is accessibility important?
Accessibility ensures your website can be used by people with disabilities, which is not only a legal requirement in many jurisdictions but also expands your potential audience and improves SEO.

### What are common accessibility issues?
Common issues include missing alt text for images, insufficient color contrast, missing form labels, and keyboard navigation problems.
