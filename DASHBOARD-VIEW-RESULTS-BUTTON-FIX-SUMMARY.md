# Dashboard "View Results" Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The "View Results" button on the dashboard was not working. When clicked, nothing happened - no errors were displayed in the console, and the user was not redirected to the scan results page.

## Fix
The fix modifies the handleViewResults function in the DashboardContent component to use window.location.href instead of router.push(). This forces a hard navigation to the scan results page, ensuring that the page reloads with the new scan ID parameter.

```typescript
// Before
const handleViewResults = (scanId: string) => {
  router.push(`/dashboard?scan=${scanId}`);
};

// After
const handleViewResults = (scanId: string) => {
  const fullUrl = `/dashboard?scan=${encodeURIComponent(scanId)}`;
  window.location.href = fullUrl;
};
```

## Implementation
- Modified `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` to fix the "View Results" button
- Added debug logging to help diagnose the issue
- Created `scripts/fix-dashboard-view-results-button.cjs` to apply the fix
- Added documentation in `docs/dashboard-view-results-button-fix.md`

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the "View Results" button for a completed scan
4. Verify that the scan results are displayed correctly
