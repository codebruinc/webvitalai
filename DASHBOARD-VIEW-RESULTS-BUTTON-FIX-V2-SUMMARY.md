# Dashboard "View Results" Button Fix V2 Summary

## Issue
The "View Results" button on the dashboard was not working. When clicked, nothing happened - no errors were displayed in the console, and the user was not redirected to the scan results page.

## Fix
The fix enhances the handleViewResults function to validate scan IDs, improves the View Results button's onClick handler, and enhances the dashboard page component to better handle scan IDs.

## Implementation
- Modified `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` to enhance the handleViewResults function and View Results button onClick handler
- Modified `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to enhance the useEffect hook that handles scan IDs
- Created `scripts/fix-dashboard-view-results-button-v2.cjs` to apply the fix
- Added documentation in `docs/dashboard-view-results-button-fix-v2.md`

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the "View Results" button for a completed scan
4. Verify that the scan results are displayed correctly
5. Check the browser console for any errors or warnings
