# Dashboard "View Results" Button Fix Summary

## Issue
The "View Results" button on the dashboard was not working. When clicked, nothing happened - no errors were displayed in the console, and the user was not redirected to the scan results page. The dashboard page was logging "Dashboard page loaded with scanId: null" even though the scan ID was being passed in the URL.

## Fix
The fix addresses several issues with URL navigation and parameter handling:

1. **Modified the handleViewResults function in DashboardContent.tsx to:**
   - Use the full URL with origin to ensure proper navigation
   - Add a fallback navigation method with a timeout
   - Provide better error handling and logging

2. **Enhanced the dashboard page component to:**
   - Store the scan ID in component state for persistence
   - Add a useEffect hook to handle URL parameter changes
   - Prevent API request caching with timestamps
   - Improve error handling and logging

## Implementation
- Modified `src/components/dashboard/DashboardContent.tsx` to improve navigation
- Modified `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to better handle URL parameters
- Added documentation in `docs/dashboard-view-results-button-fix-direct.md`

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the "View Results" button for a completed scan
4. Verify that the scan results are displayed correctly
5. Check the browser console to ensure the scan ID is being properly passed and detected
