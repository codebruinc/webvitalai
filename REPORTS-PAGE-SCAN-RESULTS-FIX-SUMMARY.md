# Reports Page Scan Results Fix Summary

## Issue
Users were unable to view past scan results from the dashboard when clicking the "View Results" button. The navigation to the dashboard page with the scan ID as a URL parameter wasn't working properly.

## Fix
Modified the reports page to directly display scan results in a modal when a user clicks "View" instead of redirecting to the dashboard page.

## Implementation
1. **Updated `src/app/reports/page.tsx`:**
   - Added state management for selected scan, loading state, and errors
   - Implemented a function to fetch scan results from the API
   - Added a modal component to display scan results using the existing ScanResults component
   - Changed the "View" link to a button that triggers the fetch function

2. **Created test script `scripts/test-reports-view.cjs`:**
   - Sets up test data for verification
   - Creates/verifies test user, websites, and scans with metrics

3. **Added documentation `docs/reports-page-scan-results-fix.md`:**
   - Detailed explanation of the issue and solution
   - Testing instructions and verification steps

## Testing
1. Run the test script to set up test data:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-reports-view.cjs
   ```

2. Navigate to the reports page, verify scans are listed, and click "View" to see scan results in a modal.
