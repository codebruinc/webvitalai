[2025-05-07 08:33:00] - Fixed Redis SSL connection issues by updating the queueService.ts file to properly handle TLS connections to Redis Cloud, improving error handling, and adding support for environment variables.
[2025-05-07 09:24:00] - Updated Redis connection configuration to use non-TLS connections instead of TLS for Redis Cloud, as testing revealed that the Redis instance is configured for non-TLS connections.

## Notes
This file tracks the current state and focus of the project. It should be updated regularly as work progresses.
[2025-05-07 12:12:14] - Fixed type error in src/services/scanService.ts by correctly accessing user_id from the websites array using scanData.websites?.[0]?.user_id instead of scanData.websites?.user_id.

[2025-05-08 09:25:00] - Fixed 406 errors in Supabase API requests by ensuring all direct Supabase client creations include proper 'Accept: application/json' and 'Content-Type: application/json' headers. Modified src/app/api/scan/route.ts to add these headers to all temporary Supabase client instances.
[2025-05-08 10:30:00] - Fixed PGRST116 "0 rows returned" errors in the scan API by modifying the GET endpoint in src/app/api/scan/route.ts to avoid using .single() when fetching scan data. The fix ensures that when RLS policies prevent access to a scan, the API returns a proper 404 error instead of crashing with a PGRST116 error. Created comprehensive documentation in docs/scan-api-pgrst116-fix.md.

[2025-05-08 11:08:39] - Fixed dashboard scan retrieval issue by modifying DashboardContent.tsx to avoid using .single() when fetching scan data. This prevents PGRST116 errors and properly handles cases where no scan data is found due to RLS policies. The fix ensures that scan data is correctly retrieved and displayed on the dashboard after running a scan.

[2025-05-08 11:18:17] - Enhanced dashboard scan retrieval fix by adding service role client usage to bypass RLS policies. Modified DashboardContent.tsx to use supabaseServiceRole for fetching scan data and metrics, added detailed logging for debugging, and implemented a refresh button to allow users to manually refresh the data. This should ensure scan data is correctly retrieved and displayed on the dashboard after running a scan.
[2025-05-08 12:09:55] - Fixed PGRST116 error in `checkAlertsForScan` (alertService.ts) by removing `.single()` and fetching scan data as an array. This prevents an error that could interrupt scan processing and display on the dashboard.
[2025-05-08 12:19:22] - Fixed 400 Bad Request error on reports page (`src/app/reports/page.tsx`) by correcting Supabase query to select `websites(url, user_id)` and filter by `websites.user_id`. Also added type assertion for `scan.websites.url`.
[2025-05-08 12:23:18] - Fixed TypeScript error in `src/app/reports/page.tsx` by correctly accessing `scan.websites[0].url` after an `Array.isArray` check, ensuring type safety when transforming scan data for the reports page.

[2025-05-09 10:27:00] - Fixed the long-standing issue with the reports page not showing any scan results by implementing a server-side API approach. Created a server-side API endpoint (`src/app/api/reports/route.ts`) that uses the service role key to bypass RLS policies and completely rewrote the reports page to use this API instead of trying to use the service role key directly in the browser. This architectural change should have been implemented much earlier in the project as it properly separates client and server concerns, ensuring the service role key is only used on the server side where it's available.
