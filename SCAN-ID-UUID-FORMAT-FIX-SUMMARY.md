# Scan ID UUID Format Fix Summary

## Issue
After implementing the scan ID format fix to prevent "default-" prefixed IDs from being used in the "View Results" button, a new issue emerged: the "View Results" button stopped working completely. No errors were displayed, but clicking the button did nothing.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the API routes where there was a strict validation check that rejected any scan ID with a "default-" prefix with a 400 error. This validation was conflicting with the recent fix in `DashboardContent.tsx` that was supposed to prevent "default-" prefixed IDs from being used in the first place.

## Fix
The fix modifies the API routes to log a warning instead of returning an error when a scan ID with a "default-" prefix is encountered. This allows the request to proceed to the service layer, where the `getScanResults` function already has proper handling for scan IDs with a "default-" prefix.

## Implementation
- Modified `src/app/api/scan/results/route.ts` to log warning instead of returning error
- Modified `src/app/api/scan/status/route.ts` to log warning instead of returning error
- Created `scripts/fix-scan-id-uuid-format.cjs` to apply the fix
- Created `scripts/test-scan-id-uuid-format-fix.cjs` to test the fix
- Added documentation in `docs/scan-id-uuid-format-fix.md`

## Verification
To verify the fix:
1. Run the application
2. Go to the dashboard
3. Click the "View Results" button for a completed scan
4. Verify that the scan results are displayed correctly
