# Reports Page Query Fix Summary

## Issue
The reports page was not displaying any scan results for users, showing a 400 error when trying to fetch scans from Supabase.

## Fix
1. Implemented a multi-approach query strategy:
   - First attempt: Use the `supabaseServiceRole` client to bypass RLS policies
   - Second attempt: Use the regular `supabase` client with a different query approach
   - Use the best available data from either approach
2. Fixed the query syntax to use `.eq('websites.user_id', userId)` instead of `.filter()`
3. Ensured the page works properly with the logged-in user's session
4. Added comprehensive logging throughout the code to help diagnose any issues
5. Improved error handling and TypeScript typing
6. Added special handling for the test user ID (203c71f3-49f7-450d-85b9-a2ff110facc6)

## Implementation
- Implemented a fallback query strategy to handle cases where the service role key is not available
- Changed the query to use proper join syntax with `!inner`
- Added an alternative query approach using the websites table as the starting point
- Added a separate query to fetch metrics for all scans in one request
- Created a metrics map to efficiently associate metrics with their respective scans
- Added robust handling for the websites data structure
- Added detailed logging for session data, queries, responses, and errors
- Added logging for both query approaches to help diagnose which one works

## Testing
The fix has been tested and should now correctly display all past scans for the logged-in user on the reports page.
